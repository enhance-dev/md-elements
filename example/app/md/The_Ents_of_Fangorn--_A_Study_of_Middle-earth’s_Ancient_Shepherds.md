# The Ents of Fangorn: A Study of Middle-earth’s Ancient Shepherds

## Origins and Role of the Ents
The Ents, created by Eru Ilúvatar at the behest of Yavanna, are guardians of the forest, embodying the primal force of nature itself. As shepherds of the trees, their primary role is to protect the forests from destruction and decay, a mission that becomes central during the events of the War of the Ring when they march against Isengard.

## Mythology and Characteristics
Ents are akin to the talking trees of many world mythologies but are uniquely Tolkienian with their deep, ancient voices and slow, deliberate mannerisms. Characters like Treebeard, the oldest of the Ents, convey a profound connection to Middle-earth’s history, emphasizing themes of environmental stewardship and the slow, often unnoticed, power of nature.

## The Last March of the Ents
The Ents’ march on Isengard represents a critical turning point in "The Lord of the Rings," symbolizing the reawakening of the world to the encroaching shadow of industrial destruction. It highlights the consequences of unchecked exploitation of natural resources, making the Ents pivotal in Tolkien’s larger commentary on the balance between nature and industry.
