## About this demo

This site's content is almost entirely generated HTML from markdown files. The markdown files are stored in the `app/md` directory and are converted to HTML on-the-fly by the server.

### `@enhance/md-elements`

The `@enhance/md-elements` package is used to convert markdown files to HTML. The package provides custom elements for including rendered HTML. Users can also directly access rendered artifacts in the Enhance application store.  
Read about it [on Github](https://github.com/enhance-dev/md-elements).
