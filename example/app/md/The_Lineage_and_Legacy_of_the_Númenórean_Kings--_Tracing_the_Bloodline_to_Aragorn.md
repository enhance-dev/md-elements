# The Lineage and Legacy of the Númenórean Kings: Tracing the Bloodline to Aragorn

> "He is Aragorn son of Arathorn, and he is descended through many fathers from Isildur Elendil’s son of Minas Ithil. He is the Chief of the Dúnedain in the North, and few are now left of that folk."

## The Rise and Fall of Númenor
Númenor, often referred to as **Westernesse**, was an island realm gifted to the Edain by the Valar in the Second Age as a reward for their aid against Morgoth during the First Age. The Númenóreans, led initially by **Elros Tar-Minyatur**, who was half-elven but chose a mortal life, quickly rose to prominence. Their kings, descendants of Elros, governed a kingdom of unparalleled might and wisdom, which eventually succumbed to pride and the desire for immortality. This led to the tragic downfall of Númenor, as chronicled in the _Akallabêth_.

> "But Sauron caused to be built upon the hill in the midst of the city of the Númenóreans, Armenelos the Golden, a mighty temple; and it was in that place that he attempted to set the pinnacle of his power, seeking to wield it over the world. But the One intervened, and the world was changed." — *Akallabêth*

## The Faithful and the Line of Kings
Amidst the cultural and political upheaval, a faction known as the *Faithful* opposed the majority's rebellion against the Valar. The Faithful preserved the ancient friendship with the Elves and adherence to the Valar. **Elendil**, a direct descendant of Elros through the line of the Faithful, escaped the cataclysm that sank Númenor. He, alongside his sons Isildur and Anárion, established the realms of Arnor and Gondor in Middle-earth. The line of kings from Elendil to Aragorn is marked by tales of heroism and the custodianship of pivotal relics like the shards of Narsil and the Sceptre of Annúminas.

## Aragorn's Claim to the Throne
Aragorn II, son of Arathorn, represents the culmination of Númenor’s legacy, being a direct descendant of Elendil and, through him, Elros Tar-Minyatur. Aragorn's claim to the thrones of Gondor and Arnor is not only through bloodline but also through his proven leadership and valor. His role as a unifier and restorer of the kingdoms that were long divided is a testament to the resilience and enduring nobility of the Númenórean bloodline. Through Aragorn, Tolkien illustrates the restoration of peace and order following the turmoil of the War of the Ring.

### Key Events in Númenor's History:
1. The establishment of Númenor by the Edain as a reward for their help in the First Age.
2. The rise of the Númenórean empire under the rule of the Kings, reaching its zenith with Tar-Minastir.
3. The shadow falling over Númenor as the Kings turn away from the Valar, leading to the influence of Sauron.
4. The downfall and submersion of Númenor following the rebellion against the Valar.
5. The escape of Elendil and his sons, leading to the foundation of the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor in Middle-earth.
